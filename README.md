  <h2> VPC </h2>
  VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud, which is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.
 Subnet
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a subnet that you select.
 Internet gateway
An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
  EC2
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, a web service that provides secure, resizable computing capacity in the cloud. Think of it as a virtual machine in the cloud.
The rest is basic networking concepts. We need to create subnets, route tables, and security groups. You also need to create network ACLs.
